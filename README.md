# Spare-Parts-Inventory-Assistant


## Project Description
This program simulates a simple spare parts inventory assistant.  
The assistant greets the user, asks which part they need, and checks against an internal database of available parts (`hydraulic pump`, `PLC module`, and `servo motor`).  
The program also handles two special queries:
- *"Do you actually have any parts?"*  
- *"Is there anything in stock at all?"*  

If one of these is entered, the assistant responds with the total number of parts in stock and lists them.  

The program continues looping until the user requests a part that is available.  
Only then does the program exit with a confirmation message.
