# Spare-Parts-Inventory-Assistant


## Project Description
This program simulates a simple spare parts inventory assistant.  
The assistant greets the user, asks which part they need, and checks against an internal database of available parts (`hydraulic pump`, `PLC module`, and `servo motor`).  
The program also handles two special queries:
- *"Do you actually have any parts?"*  
- *"Is there anything in stock at all?"*  

If one of these is entered, the assistant responds with the total number of parts in stock and lists them.  

The program continues looping until the user requests a part that is available.  
Only then does the program exit with a confirmation message.

## Features
- Takes user input for requested part  
- Handles special queries (case-sensitive, exact text)  
- Checks if the requested part is in inventory  
- Loops until a valid part is found  
- Exits only after confirming that a part is available

## How to Compile and Run

### Option 1: Run in an Online C Compiler
If GCC is not available, you can use an online C compiler such as:  
üëâ [Programiz Online C Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/)  

### Option 2: Compile with GCC locally
```bash
gcc main.c 
inventory.exe   # on Windows

## **Note**:

fgets() is used instead of scanf("%s", ‚Ä¶) so the program can read the whole line including spaces.
For example:

Input: hydraulic pump ‚Üí fgets reads it correctly ‚úÖ

Input: hydraulic pump ‚Üí scanf("%s", ‚Ä¶) would only read hydraulic ‚ùå

This ensures multi-word parts like "hydraulic pump" and "PLC module" work as expected.
